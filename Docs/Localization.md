# Localization Contributor Guide

Bloodcraft uses hash-based localization. Follow these steps when adding or editing messages.

Before introducing a new message, check the catalog in
`Docs/MessageKeys.md` to avoid creating duplicate entries. Run
`python Tools/generate_message_catalog.py` if you change
`Resources/Localization/Messages/English.json` so the catalog stays
current.

## Replace interpolated strings

Instead of C# string interpolation, use `LocalizationService.Reply` with numbered placeholders:

```csharp
LocalizationService.Reply(ctx, "You're level {0}", level);
```

## Update language JSONs

When you add or change a message, update every JSON file under `Resources/Localization/Messages` to include the same numbered placeholders `{0}`, `{1}`, etc. so translations match the English template.

Propagate hash keys from the English source into each language file by running:

```bash
python Tools/propagate_hashes.py Resources/Localization/Messages/<Language>.json
```

The script preserves existing translations, adds any new English hashes, and removes obsolete ones. See [`Tools/propagate_hashes.py`](../Tools/propagate_hashes.py) for details.

## Automated Translation for Messages

Only the JSON files in `Resources/Localization/Messages` contain user-facing messages. Use Argos Translate to automate translating these files.

Argos models are stored under `Resources/Localization/Models/<LANG>` as split archives and must be reconstructed and installed at the start of each session:

1. **Reassemble and install the model**

   ```bash
   cd Resources/Localization/Models/<LANG>
   cat translate-*.z[0-9][0-9] translate-*.zip > model.zip
   unzip -o model.zip
   unzip -p translate-*.argosmodel */metadata.json | jq '.from_code, .to_code'
   argos-translate install translate-*.argosmodel
   ```

   Run these commands every session to rebuild the model archive and confirm the `from_code`/`to_code` pair.

2. **Verify model installation**

   Ensure the Argos model for your target language is installed:

   ```bash
   argos-translate --from en --to <iso-code> - < /dev/null
   ```

3. **Run the translator**

   ```bash
   python Tools/translate_argos.py Resources/Localization/Messages/<Language>.json --to <iso-code> --batch-size 100 --max-retries 3 --log-level INFO --overwrite
   ```

   Omitting `--overwrite` translates only missing entries and keeps existing
   translations intact. Use `--overwrite` sparingly, as it retranslates every
  line and can reprocess thousands of entries unnecessarily. Outputs are saved
  under `translations/<iso-code>/<timestamp>/` by default; override with
  `--run-dir` if a custom location is desired. The translator writes
  `translate.log`, `skipped.csv`, and `metrics.json` to this run
  directory and appends a summary to `translations/run_index.json`.
  Omitting `--log-file` or `--report-file` constructs these defaults within
  the run directory, and the script prints the resolved locations at
  startup for easy discovery.

   To refresh specific messages without touching the rest, pass one or more
   `--hash <hash>` options to translate only those hashes.

   Each run ends with a summary line similar to:

   ```
   Totals: processed=500 translated=498 skipped=2 failures=1
   ```

   The script exits with a non-zero status when any skips or failures remain so CI can detect issues.

4. **Handle skipped rows**

   Any hashes listed in `skipped.csv` within the run directory must be
   translated manually. Re-run the translator until the file is empty.
   Summarise each run and fail fast on unresolved issues:

   ```bash
   python Tools/validate_translation_run.py --run-dir translations/<iso-code>/<timestamp>
   ```

   The script reports how many entries were translated or skipped and
   exits non-zero when any `token_mismatch` or `sentinel` problems remain.

   To review skip categories at a glance, run:

   ```bash
   python Tools/analyze_skip_report.py translations/<iso-code>/<timestamp>/skipped.csv
   ```

   This prints the number of rows per category so manual fixes can be prioritised.

### Sample translation dataset

`Resources/Localization/Messages/Spanish_sample.json` provides roughly twenty English messages with numbered placeholders and `<color>` tags. It is intended for experimenting with the translation tooling.

Translate and validate this dataset automatically with:

```bash
make sample-translate
```



   To extract hashes that were skipped due to token mismatches, scan the
   translation log:

   ```bash
   python Tools/collect_skipped_hashes.py --run-dir translations/<iso-code>/<timestamp> --csv mismatches.csv
   ```

   Omit `--csv` to print the unique hashes to stdout.

   ### Interpolation blocks

   Entries containing C# interpolation expressions like `{(condition ? "A" : "B")}` are skipped
   automatically and appear in `skipped.csv` with the `interpolation` category. To translate them:

   1. Locate the hash in the target language JSON file.
   2. Translate only the surrounding text, leaving the `{(...)}` block untouched.
   3. Run `python Tools/fix_tokens.py` for that JSON file.
   4. Re-run the translator to verify the hash no longer appears in `skipped.csv`.

   ### Placeholder-only results

    Sometimes the translator may output only `[[TOKEN_n]]` placeholders without any surrounding text. These messages are left in their original English form and appear in `skipped.csv` with the `placeholder` category so they can be reviewed manually.

    ### Manual review script

    Use `Tools/review_skipped.py skipped_Spanish.csv` to list each skipped hash with its current Spanish text. Replace the English strings in `Resources/Localization/Messages/Spanish.json` with manual translations, then run:

    ```bash
    python Tools/fix_tokens.py Resources/Localization/Messages/Spanish.json
    python Tools/translate_argos.py Resources/Localization/Messages/Spanish.json --to es --overwrite
    ```

    Re-run the translator until `skipped_Spanish.csv` is empty and verify the catalog:

    ```bash
    dotnet run --project Bloodcraft.csproj -p:RunGenerateREADME=false -- check-translations
    ```

4. **Fix tokens**

   ```bash
   python Tools/fix_tokens.py --check-only Resources/Localization/Messages/<Language>.json
   python Tools/fix_tokens.py Resources/Localization/Messages/<Language>.json
   ```

   Run the check-only mode first to fail fast if tokens were altered, then apply the fixes.

### Token warnings

Argos may reorder or drop placeholder tokens during translation. The translation log highlights these issues:

```text
2024-02-24T12:00:00Z WARNING 3981447812 tokens reordered (expected ['0', '1'], got ['1', '0'])
```

When placeholders move, the log shows the original and translated strings for the affected hash:

```
Original: "<color=yellow>{0}</color> has {1} apples"
Result:   "<color=yellow>{1}</color> tiene {0} manzanas"
```

A token count mismatch appears when placeholders are dropped entirely:

```
2844729307: token mismatch on strict retry (expected ['0', '1'], got [])
```

#### Validation steps

Use `fix_tokens.py` to detect and repair token problems. Start with a dry run to surface warnings without modifying files:

```
python Tools/fix_tokens.py --check-only Resources/Localization/Messages/Spanish.json
Resources/Localization/Messages/Spanish.json: 3981447812 tokens reordered
```

Apply the fixes and reâ€‘run in check-only mode to confirm a clean result:

```
python Tools/fix_tokens.py Resources/Localization/Messages/Spanish.json
python Tools/fix_tokens.py --check-only Resources/Localization/Messages/Spanish.json
```

Finally, verify the language files contain no token mismatches or leftover English text:

```
dotnet run --project Bloodcraft.csproj -p:RunGenerateREADME=false -- check-translations --show-text
```

The check should report no token mismatches or leftover English text.

## Verify translation hashes

After updating the files, run:

```bash
dotnet run --project Bloodcraft.csproj -p:RunGenerateREADME=false -- check-translations --summary-json summary.json
```

The command should report no hash changes, confirming placeholders are aligned across languages. Use `--summary-json <path>` to capture aggregate counts per language.

## Automated validation

The CI pipeline runs the following checks and fails if any English text remains or tokens are malformed:

```bash
python Tools/fix_tokens.py --check-only Resources/Localization/Messages/*.json
dotnet run --project Bloodcraft.csproj -p:RunGenerateREADME=false -- check-translations
```

## Build-time check

A check runs during the build to ensure `LocalizationService.Reply` does not receive raw string
literals or interpolated strings. Instead, reference a `MessageKeys` constant or other
localization identifier. The script uses a baseline file to track existing violations:

```bash
python Tools/check_localization_reply.py --update-baseline  # refresh baseline after fixing strings
```

If new string literals are introduced, the build will fail until they are removed or added to the
baseline.

## Scan source for untranslated strings

Run `scan_english.py` to highlight English phrases in C# files that are not wrapped in
`LocalizationService` helpers:

```bash
python Tools/scan_english.py
```

You can skip directories or file patterns that should not be scanned:

```bash
python Tools/scan_english.py --whitelist-dir Bloodcraft.Tests --whitelist-pattern "^Generated/"
```

Use this to quickly locate messages that still need localization.

## Debugging & Metrics

### Localization pipeline

Enable verbose logging and capture end-to-end metrics when running the
full pipeline:

```bash
python Tools/localization_pipeline.py --debug
```

Override the output paths for aggregate metrics and skipped hashes with
`--metrics-file` and `--skipped-file` (defaults are `localization_metrics.json`
and `skipped.csv` in the repository root):

```bash
python Tools/localization_pipeline.py --debug --metrics-file metrics.json --skipped-file skipped.csv
```

Pass `--archive-logs` to archive each run directory under
`TranslationLogs/<commit>/<timestamp>` for later investigation. Commit these
directories to the repository so post-mortem reviews can trace issues back to
the exact code version.

This writes `localization_metrics.json` (or the path provided via
`--metrics-file`). Each step records start/end timestamps and per-language
results. A successful run looks like:

```json
{
  "steps": {
    "generation": {"start": "2024-02-20T12:00:00Z", "end": "2024-02-20T12:00:01Z"},
    "propagation": {"start": "â€¦", "end": "â€¦"},
    "translation": {"start": "â€¦", "end": "â€¦"},
    "token_fix": {"start": "â€¦", "end": "â€¦"},
    "verification": {"start": "â€¦", "end": "â€¦", "returncode": 0}
  },
  "languages": {
    "Turkish": {
      "translation": {"returncode": 0, "duration": 1.2},
      "token_fix": {"returncode": 0, "duration": 0.3},
      "skipped_hash_count": 0,
      "success": true
    }
  }
}
```

Nonâ€‘zero `returncode` values or `success: false` indicate a failed step.

### Automatic translation

`translate_argos.py` appends metrics for each run when `--metrics-file`
is specified (default `metrics.json` under `--root`). Each run also updates
`translations/run_index.json`:

```bash
python Tools/translate_argos.py Resources/Localization/Messages/Turkish.json --to tr --metrics-file metrics.json
```

An entry records the run ID, git commit, Python and Argos Translate versions,
model version, paths to the log, report and metrics files, run directory, CLI
arguments, and summarises successes, timeouts, token reorders and perâ€‘hash token
statistics. If the run terminates early, ``error`` notes the reason:

```json
[
  {
    "run_id": "123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000",
    "git_commit": "abcdef1",
    "python_version": "3.11.0",
    "argos_version": "1.8.0",
    "model_version": "1",
    "cli_args": {
      "target_file": "Resources/Localization/Messages/Turkish.json",
      "src": "en",
      "dst": "tr",
      "batch_size": 100,
      "max_retries": 3,
      "timeout": 60,
      "overwrite": false
    },
    "log_file": "translations/tr/2024-02-20/translate.log",
    "report_file": "translations/tr/2024-02-20/skipped.csv",
    "metrics_file": "translations/tr/2024-02-20/metrics.json",
    "run_dir": "translations/tr/2024-02-20",
    "file": "Resources/Localization/Messages/Turkish.json",
    "timestamp": "2024-02-20T12:00:02Z",
    "processed": 500,
    "successes": 498,
    "timeouts": 2,
    "token_reorders": 1,
    "failures": {},
    "hash_stats": {
      "1234567890": {
        "original_tokens": 2,
        "translated_tokens": 2,
        "reordered": false
      }
    }
  }
]
```

### Token fixer

Record how many placeholders were restored or reordered by supplying
`--metrics-file` to `fix_tokens.py`:

```bash
python Tools/fix_tokens.py Resources/Localization/Messages/Turkish.json --metrics-file fix_tokens_metrics.json
```

The metrics file reports token changes and mismatches:

```json
{
  "tokens_restored": 4,
  "tokens_reordered": 1,
  "token_mismatches": 0
}
```

### Log analysis

Use `analyze_translation_logs.py` to summarise unresolved issues across
translations:

```bash
python Tools/analyze_translation_logs.py
```

By default, the script reads `metrics.json` and `skipped.csv` from
the repository root. Override these paths to analyse a specific run directory:

```bash
python Tools/analyze_translation_logs.py --run-dir translations/fr/2025-05-16
```

The script lists token mismatches or placeholder-only entries and exits
non-zero when problems remain so CI and contributors can investigate.

For a focused view of hashes with mismatched or reordered tokens recorded in
`metrics.json`, run:

```bash
python Tools/summarize_token_stats.py --run-dir translations/fr/2025-05-16 --top 20
```

This prints a table of problematic hashes; add `--csv output.csv` to write the
results to disk.

## Troubleshooting & Notes

- **Argos model installation**: If the `argos-translate install` subcommand is unavailable, reassemble the split archives as shown above and install using the Python API each session:
  ```bash
  cd Resources/Localization/Models/EN_ES
  cat translate-*.z[0-9][0-9] translate-*.zip > model.zip
  unzip -o model.zip
  python - <<'PY'
  import argostranslate.package
  argostranslate.package.install_from_path('translate-en_es-1_0.argosmodel')
  PY
  ```
- **Slow translations**: High `--log-level` values like `INFO` or `DEBUG` can produce huge output and slow processing. Consider using `WARNING` or lowering `--batch-size`.
- **Missing SDKs**: `dotnet` may be absent on minimal systems; ensure the .NET SDK is installed before running checks.
- **.NET 6 runtime**: The project targets .NET 6; install `dotnet-runtime-6.0` from Microsoft's package feed even if newer SDKs are present.
- **Translator stalls**: After reporting skipped rows the translator may appear idle; lower `--batch-size` or reduce `--log-level` to speed it up.
- **Token mismatches**: Entries listed in `skipped.csv` often need manual review and translation.

### Follow-up
- Improve token handling in `translate_argos.py` to reduce `skipped.csv` entries.
- Provide progress indicators or low-noise defaults for lengthy translation runs.
