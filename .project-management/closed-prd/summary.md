# Hashed Localization Completion Summary

All tasks outlined in `hashed-localization-prd.md` and detailed in `hashed-localization-tasks.md` have been completed. The plugin now supports hashed message localization with configuration for `PluginLanguage`, tooling for generating and verifying translations, and commands have been migrated to the new API. No major blockers were encountered.

**Lessons Learned**
- Automating translation file generation reduces manual errors.
- Early migration of commands helps validate the localization pipeline.
